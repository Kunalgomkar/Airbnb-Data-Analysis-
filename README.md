## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes publicly available Airbnb open data to gain insights into the short-term rental market. It focuses on understanding pricing trends, neighborhood performance, host behavior, and customer preferences. The dataset is thoroughly cleaned and processed to ensure high-quality analysis before conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Various visualizations are used to uncover patterns related to demand, availability, room types, and review behavior. Neighborhood-wise insights help identify regions with high profitability and consistent booking activity. Correlation studies further reveal how different factors influence price variations. Interactive charts and maps enable deeper exploration of market dynamics. Overall, this project delivers meaningful insights that can assist hosts, travelers, and businesses in making informed decisions based on real data.
